# Toddler Calendar

A quick and dirty tool to create calendars for kids that switch homes. I created this for myself because I needed it. It is sufficient for me as is but lacks some features that I would have liked to add before publishing it. Iâ€™m already in the process of rewriting this including these TODOs.

# TODO

- Make colors adjustable _colors are for everyone_
- Make it responsive and suitable for mobile
- Add collaboration
- Make first day of the week adjustable
- Use sprite map for emojis
- Maybe add some tests
- Improve code quality
